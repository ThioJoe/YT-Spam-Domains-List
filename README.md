# Crowd Sourced YouTube Comments Spam List:
## Various lists of known scam domains, fake scam accounts on Instagram, Telegram, etc.

### What Is This?
I have a project, which I made in python, which detects scam/spam comments, and lets you delete or report the comments, depending if your the channel owner of a channel viewer. This is the repo of the list of the scam comment links, with any links added here, the bot will automatically detect them in comments and filter them out in the bot.

You can check out the project [here](https://github.com/ThioJoe/YT-Spammer-Purge)

### Current Lists:
- SpamDomainsList: Domains used in scam YouTube comments

### How to Contribute:
- You can submit an **issue** with domains to add, but they MUST contain a direct link to a spam comment as proof, or a video on which many obvious spam comments are promoting the domain.
- Remember: A zero false positive rate must be the highest priority
- Please refrain from submitting pull requests, and instead just use issues as submissions. This will make it easier for me to manage the version/date and merge conflicts
