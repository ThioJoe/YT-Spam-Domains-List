# Crowd Sourced YouTube Comments Spam List:
## Various lists of known scam domains, fake scam accounts on Instagram, Telegram, etc.

### Current Lists:
- SpamDomainsList: Domains used in scam YouTube comments

### How to Contribute:
- You can submit an **issue** with domains to add, but they MUST contain a direct link/screenshot to a spam comment as proof, or a video on which many obvious spam comments are promoting the domain.
- Remember: A zero false positive rate must be the highest priority
- Please refrain from submitting pull requests, and instead just use issues as submissions. This will make it easier for me to manage the version/date and merge conflicts
