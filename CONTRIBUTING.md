# Contributing Guidelines
- You can submit an **issue** with domains to add, but they MUST contain a direct link to a spam comment as proof, or a video on which many obvious spam comments are promoting the domain.
- Remember: A zero false positive rate must be the highest priority
- Please refrain from submitting pull requests, and instead just use issues as submissions. This will make it easier for me to manage the version/date and merge conflicts
- Please read about the categories [in the Wiki](https://github.com/ThioJoe/YT-Spam-Domains-List/wiki) before submitting
